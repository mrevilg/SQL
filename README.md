Basic Key Words
SELECT is the clause we use every time we want to query information from a database.
AS renames a column or table.
DISTINCT return unique values.
WHERE is a popular command that lets you filter the results of the query based on conditions that you specify.
LIKE and BETWEEN are special operators.
AND and OR combines multiple conditions.
ORDER BY sorts the result.
LIMIT specifies the maximum number of rows that the query will return.
CASE creates different outputs.

 CASE

  WHEN review > 4 THEN 'Excellent'
  WHEN review > 3 THEN 'Good'
  WHEN review > 2 THEN 'Fair'
  ELSE 'Poor'
 END AS 'Review'

COUNT(): count the number of rows
SUM(): the sum of the values in a column
MAX()/MIN(): the largest/smallest value
AVG(): the average of the values in a column
ROUND(): round the values in the column

GROUP BY is a clause in SQL that is used with aggregate functions. It is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to arrange identical data into groups.

The GROUP BY statement comes after any WHERE statements, but before ORDER BY or LIMIT.

When we want to limit the results of a query based on values of the individual rows, use WHERE. When we want to limit the results of a query based on an aggregate property, use HAVING. HAVING statement always comes after GROUP BY, but before ORDER BY and LIMIT.
